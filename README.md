# Machine Learning Projects

This repository is part of my computer science and engineering learning portfolio.

It contains some of the projects I worked on this summer, exploring key concepts and algorithms in machine learning. I worked on image classification, prediction models, and algorithmic understanding using Python. These projects helped me understand how data and algorithms come together to make predictions and automate learning.

### Tools and Libraries
- Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook for experiments and visualization  

### Focus Areas
- Classification and regression modeling  
- Feature engineering and data preprocessing  
- Building and evaluating CNNs and decision trees  

### Reflection
These projects strengthened my understanding of model design and performance analysis. I also learned how to fine tune these models,interpret results and communicate my understanding clearly.
