# Machine Learning Projects

This folder is part of my computer science and engineering learning portfolio.

It contains a set of Python scripts and notebooks that explore core machine-learning and data-analysis concepts. I used public datasets and algorithmic experiments to deepen my understanding of how models learn from data and make predictions.

## Project Highlights

| Project | Description | Key Techniques |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Number Classification** | Built a model to classify handwritten or generated numbers. | Feature engineering, decision trees, accuracy evaluation |
| **COVID-19 Chest X-ray Classification** | Created a classifier to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. | CNN, image preprocessing, data augmentation |
| **Stock Price Regression (API Integration Template)** | Used live financial APIs with regression models to predict stock trends. | API calls, Pandas, regression, plotting |
| **Projectile Motion Plotting** | Modeled physics projectile motion and visualized results. | Kinematics, data visualization, Matplotlib |
| Additional scripts | Include datasets like baseball, Pokémon, Nim game algorithms, NBA draft picks and more. | Data cleaning, algorithmic problem-solving, visualization |

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Scikit-learn, PyTorch  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Learning Outcomes
This collection helped me to:
- Gain hands-on experience with machine-learning workflows: data cleaning → modeling → evaluation  
- Interpret model performance, visualize results, and communicate insights  
- Combine domain knowledge (sports, finance, games, physics) with computational methods  
- Develop discipline in documenting code, organizing scripts, and maintaining readability

Feel free to explore the individual scripts and notebooks. I keep adding and updating this repository as I build new projects and deepen my learning.
